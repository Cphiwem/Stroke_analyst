Analyzing Stroke Datasets
This analysis examines stroke datasets to uncover significant patterns and risk factors associated with stroke occurrence.
We will also develop and evaluate predictive models to accurately identify patients at risk of having a 
stroke based on various health and demographic features. This comprehensive approach aims to provide valuable insights 
for early detection and prevention strategies in healthcare
